I"ä<p>You know when you just get tired of everything else you‚Äôve been working on the last few years and decide to start fresh?</p>

<p><strong>That‚Äôs not what happened to me</strong>.</p>

<p>I still love what I do and I‚Äôll keep working on my side projects and learning new languages and everything. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been reading a lot about the <strong>cloud</strong> <strong>architecture</strong> and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I need to invest in this.</p>

<p>So, this is it. This is the start of my journey through <strong>AWS</strong> and I‚Äôll try to describe all of the things that helped me on this path. All the <strong>good resources</strong>, <strong>cool people</strong> and <strong>tools</strong> will be featured here. Wish me luck \o/</p>

<h2 id="iam---identity-and-access-management">IAM - Identity and Access Management</h2>

<p>The Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a AWS service that enables you to manage the access to your AWS services and resources.</p>

<p>With IAM you can control who has access to your AWS account, what type of access they have to what service and what actions can be executed.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a set of keywords that are crucial to understanding this service, as described below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">User</a> - Normally is created to represent a person or application can interact with AWS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html">Group</a> - Is a collection of Users. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage their permissions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">Role</a> - Almost like a User. You can use roles to give access to users, applications, or services that don‚Äôt normally have access to your AWS resources.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/manage-permissions/">Permission</a> - Permissions let you establish access to AWS resources to IAM entities (users, groups, and roles). Without your permissions, entities can‚Äôt use anything on your AWS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">Policy</a> - A policy defines the permissions are associated with some identity or resource. Policies consist of three attributes that define what type of access you have:
    <ul>
      <li>Effect - Allow or Deny permission</li>
      <li>Action - API calls that can be made</li>
      <li>Resource - Scope of entities that the policy rule covers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>

<h4 id="lock-your-account-root-user-and-create-individual-iam-users">Lock your account root user and create individual IAM users</h4>

<p>The root account access key gives full access to all the services and billing information, therefore root access should be handled very carefully.</p>

<h4 id="enable-multi-factor-authentication-for-all-users">Enable multi-factor authentication for all users</h4>

<p>MFA grants you another layer of protection. If some user‚Äôs access is compromised, there‚Äôs still another layer of security to be broken by some kind of attacker.</p>

<h4 id="grant-least-privilege-to-users-and-resources">Grant least privilege to users and resources</h4>

<p>Give your users and resources only the necessary permissions to perform the specific task that they‚Äôll be working on.</p>

<h4 id="configure-a-strong-password-policy-for-your-users">Configure a strong password policy for your users</h4>

<p>Everyone should avoid ‚Äúpassword‚Äù and ‚Äú123456‚Äù passwords. Make your users choose strong ones, with numbers and special characters with minimum number of characters.</p>

<h4 id="monitor-activity-in-your-aws-account-and-remove-unnecessary-credentials">Monitor activity in your AWS account and Remove unnecessary credentials</h4>

<p>Monitoring your AWS logs can be useful to check the date and time of each users‚Äô actions, and therefore review their permissions and remove credentials that aren‚Äôt related to them.</p>

<h4 id="setup-cloudtrail">Setup CloudTrail</h4>

<p>CloudTrail creates a ‚Äútrail‚Äù of events for actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service.</p>

<h4 id="dont-commit-credentials-to-git">Don‚Äôt commit credentials to git</h4>

<p>This one is just common sense actually.</p>

<hr />

<p>IAM may seem a really basic tool when you start using it, but as the complexity of your systems increases, so does the amount of attention you have to give to IAM.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed this first chapter, stay tuned for more! ;D</p>
